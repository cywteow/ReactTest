# Libraries
1. Material-UI

  The reason for choosing MaterialUI is because end users are usually familiar with google-like UI.
  
2. Axios

  I used to axios instead of AJAX because i think axios should be the right way for calling APIs in NodeJS. AJAX is pretty old and it's mostly for pure javascript.
  
3. Moment.js

  This should be the right datetime library for NodeJS as compared to pure javascript Date().
  
There are other libraries I usually use for react like lodash (util) and tailwind (css). However this test is very straightforward so it is not necessarry to use them.
